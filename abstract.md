# Version Control with Git
## KSETA Doktorandenworkshop Freudenstadt 2014

Git is a distributed version control system everybody should know about. It is the way to share code. It is the way to contribute to open source projects. But it is also the way to manage personal projects like the PhD thesis. It makes you capable of tracking changes (including errors), automatic backups, branching and merging, and so on.

The workshop will give an introduction to Git, and show how it makes your workflow more productive day-to-day. After a general presentation, there will be a hands-on group session. This will not only cover the basics but also more advanced topics like merging different branches including conflicting changes.
